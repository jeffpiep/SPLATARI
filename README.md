# SPLATARI
SPLATARI is Splatoon for 2 players in 8 bits for the ATARI 800XL written in TurboBASIC XL. This is an entry to the [BASIC 10Liners 2017](http://gkanold.wixsite.com/homeputerium/basic-10liners-2017) competition.

[Download](https://github.com/jeffpiep/SPLATARI/raw/master/SPLATARI.atr) the ATR file and play on your favorite 800XL emulator (e.g., [Altirra](http://www.virtualdub.org/altirra.html)).

SPLATARI requires two joysticks to play. Move your squid around the screen and splat ink by pressing fire. You have 180 seconds to beat your opponent by inking more of the screen than them. Run out of ink? Swim or rest in your own color. But be careful! You lose health when you swim through your opponent's ink color. Lose all your health and you get sent back to your wall. If you and your opponent collide, you both get knocked back to your respective walls. There's no time to rest because you don't know the score until the time runs out and the counting is done. Press fire to play it again.
